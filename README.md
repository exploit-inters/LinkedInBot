LinkedIn bot to act as your own secretary to schedule job interviews

Has a recruiter ever told you they were impressed by your background but never mention in detail what they liked?

That is because recruiters have gotten lazy sending the same generic message to a large number of individuals

This is deceiving behavior and you waste your time. Recruiters can be easily replaced and your time is far more valuable than theirs

This robot will filter out the lazy recruiters and schedule interviews with only the best leads including... (not limited to)

1. Use natural langauge processing (NLP) to engage in conversation with human recruiters
2. Interface with Google Calendar to schedule interviews when available
3. Ensure the job is located in your city of choice
4. Confirm the job duties (example you desire a java opportunity, but the job offer is c#)
5. Ignore recruiters who don't answer the bot's questions (example "could we just hop on a call and talk for 5 minutes?")
6. Modify your LinkedIn profile daily, updating your profile increases your visibility
